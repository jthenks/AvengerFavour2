This program is the second iteration of AvengerFavour1. In this version, arraylists were replaced with singly linked lists using nodes. This replacement was conducted strictly 
for learning purposes.

This program searches through text files to locate keywords. The keywords in this case are Avengers (character name, or alias). This program then creates Avenger objects
for each character, creates nodes for each Avenger, and tracks the amount of times they are mentioned. Avengers are then added to multiple different singly linked lists
and sorted based on the desired comparison algorithms.

This was a university assignment that was submitted as a .jar file for easy output comparison. There is a placeholder in the java files that allows for manual .txt file selection.

This program was created in a team of three. My personal contribution was the creation of the Avenger class, both comparators, and the majority of the SLL class.
